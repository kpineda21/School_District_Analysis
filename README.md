- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?
    Replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores moved Thomas High School from 2nd ranked to the 8th ranked school out of 15 schools. 
- Recalculate the scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?
- Math and Reading Scores by Grade
    By replacing the ninth grade scores, they no longer have a score to determine where they fall within the 15 schools
- Scores by School Spending
    Replacing the ninth grade scores does not affect the school spending because each student is still accounted for we just replaced their grades with NaN's 
- Scores by School Size
This is also not affected because the students were not removed from the count
- Scores by School Type
The school type is also not affected because that is not determined by the ninth graders grades
